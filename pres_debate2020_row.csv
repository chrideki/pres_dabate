Chris Wallace:,1:20,9/29/20,1,20,0:01:20,0:00:00,0:00:00,"Good evening from the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 Presidential Debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential debates. The Commission has designed the format, six roughly 15 minute segments with two minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates."
Chris Wallace:,2:10,9/29/20,2,10,0:02:10,0:00:50,0:00:50,"This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the Health Security advisor to the Commission for all four debates. As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight's debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee Vice President Biden."
Vice President ...:,2:49,9/29/20,2,49,0:02:49,0:01:29,0:01:29,"How you doing, man?"
President Donal...:,2:51,9/29/20,2,51,0:02:51,0:01:31,0:01:31,How are you doing?
Vice President ...:,2:51,9/29/20,2,51,0:02:51,0:01:31,0:01:31,I'm well.
Chris Wallace:,3:11,9/29/20,3,11,0:03:11,0:01:51,0:01:51,"Gentlemen, a lot of people been waiting for this night, so let's get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate's to consider a nominee to the Court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the President and Republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court? President Trump, in this first segment, you go first. Two minutes."
President Donal...:,4:01,9/29/20,4,1,0:04:01,0:02:41,0:02:41,"Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she's going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she's the single greatest student he's ever had. He's been a professor for a long time at a great school."
President Donal...:,4:53,9/29/20,4,53,0:04:53,0:03:33,0:03:33,"And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn't even think about not doing it. The only difference is they'd try and do it faster. There's no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn't have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris."
Chris Wallace:,5:22,9/29/20,5,22,0:05:22,0:04:02,0:04:02,"President Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Vice President Biden. You have two minutes."
Vice President ...:,5:29,9/29/20,5,29,0:05:29,0:04:09,0:04:09,"Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President."
President Donal...:,5:34,9/29/20,5,34,0:05:34,0:04:14,0:04:14,"Thank you, Joe."
Vice President ...:,5:36,9/29/20,5,36,0:05:36,0:04:16,0:04:16,The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that's the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President.
Vice President ...:,6:12,9/29/20,6,12,0:06:12,0:04:52,0:04:52,"Now, what's at stake here is the President's made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He's been running on that, he ran on that and he's been governing on that. He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I'm not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she's written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that's on the court, and if it's struck down, what happens? Women's rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets."
Vice President ...:,7:08,9/29/20,7,8,0:07:08,0:05:48,0:05:48,"And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there's a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they'll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February."
President Donal...:,7:34,9/29/20,7,34,0:07:34,0:06:14,0:06:14,"There aren't a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. We're not elected for three years. I'm not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President-"
Vice President ...:,8:01,9/29/20,8,1,0:08:01,0:06:41,0:06:41,He's elected to the next election.
President Donal...:,8:02,9/29/20,8,2,0:08:02,0:06:42,0:06:42,"During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I'm not elected for three years. I'm elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don't know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you're going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they're very happy this."
Vice President ...:,8:24,9/29/20,8,24,0:08:24,0:07:04,0:07:04,That's simply not true.
President Donal...:,8:25,9/29/20,8,25,0:08:25,0:07:05,0:07:05,"Well, you're certainly going to socialist. You're going to socialist-"
Chris Wallace:,8:29,9/29/20,8,29,0:08:29,0:07:09,0:07:09,"Gentlemen, we're now into open discussion."
Vice President ...:,8:31,9/29/20,8,31,0:08:31,0:07:11,0:07:11,Open discussion.
Chris Wallace:,8:32,9/29/20,8,32,0:08:32,0:07:12,0:07:12,"Open discussion, yes, I agree. Go ahead, Vice President."
Vice President ...:,8:33,9/29/20,8,33,0:08:33,0:07:13,0:07:13,"Number one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can. They do. They will under my proposal."
President Donal...:,8:58,9/29/20,8,58,0:08:58,0:07:38,0:07:38,That's not what you've said and it's not what your party is saying.
Vice President ...:,9:00,9/29/20,9,0,0:09:00,0:07:40,0:07:40,That is simply a lie.
President Donal...:,9:02,9/29/20,9,2,0:09:02,0:07:42,0:07:42,Your party doesn't say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare.
Vice President ...:,9:05,9/29/20,9,5,0:09:05,0:07:45,0:07:45,"The party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party."
President Donal...:,9:08,9/29/20,9,8,0:09:08,0:07:48,0:07:48,"And they're going to dominate you, Joe. You know that."
Vice President ...:,9:09,9/29/20,9,9,0:09:09,0:07:49,0:07:49,I am the Democratic Party right now.
President Donal...:,9:11,9/29/20,9,11,0:09:11,0:07:51,0:07:51,Not according to Harris.
Vice President ...:,9:12,9/29/20,9,12,0:09:12,0:07:52,0:07:52,"The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here's the deal. The deal is that it's going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there's seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?"
President Donal...:,9:39,9/29/20,9,39,0:09:39,0:08:19,0:08:19,"Joe, you've had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn't provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don't tell me about this."
Vice President ...:,9:47,9/29/20,9,47,0:09:47,0:08:27,0:08:27,I'm happy to talk about this.
President Donal...:,9:48,9/29/20,9,48,0:09:48,0:08:28,0:08:28,"And if you were here, it wouldn't be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn't want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn't want me to ban Europe."
Chris Wallace:,9:58,9/29/20,9,58,0:09:58,0:08:38,0:08:38,"All right, gentlemen, Mr. President."
President Donal...:,10:00,9/29/20,10,0,0:10:00,0:08:40,0:08:40,"You would have been much later, Joe, much later."
Chris Wallace:,10:04,9/29/20,10,4,0:10:04,0:08:44,0:08:44,Mr. President.
President Donal...:,10:04,9/29/20,10,4,0:10:04,0:08:44,0:08:44,We're talking about two million people.
Vice President ...:,10:05,9/29/20,10,5,0:10:05,0:08:45,0:08:45,You're not going to be able to shut him up.
Chris Wallace:,10:06,9/29/20,10,6,0:10:06,0:08:46,0:08:46,"Mr. President, as the moderator, we are going to talk about COVID in the next segment. But go ahead."
Vice President ...:,10:11,9/29/20,10,11,0:10:11,0:08:51,0:08:51,"Let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade. That's on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that's also at stake right now. And so the election is all-"
President Donal...:,10:25,9/29/20,10,25,0:10:25,0:09:05,0:09:05,You don't know what's on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It's not on the ballot.
Vice President ...:,10:31,9/29/20,10,31,0:10:31,0:09:11,0:09:11,It's on the ballot in the court.
President Donal...:,10:32,9/29/20,10,32,0:10:32,0:09:12,0:09:12,I don't think so.
Vice President ...:,10:33,9/29/20,10,33,0:10:33,0:09:13,0:09:13,In the court.
President Donal...:,10:34,9/29/20,10,34,0:10:34,0:09:14,0:09:14,There's nothing happening there.
Vice President ...:,10:35,9/29/20,10,35,0:10:35,0:09:15,0:09:15,Donald would you just be quiet for a minute.
President Donal...:,10:36,9/29/20,10,36,0:10:36,0:09:16,0:09:16,You don't know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don't know here view.
Chris Wallace:,10:40,9/29/20,10,40,0:10:40,0:09:20,0:09:20,"Well, all right. All right. Let's talk. We've got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We've got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we'll come back to Roe V. Wade."
Vice President ...:,10:51,9/29/20,10,51,0:10:51,0:09:31,0:09:31,All right.
Chris Wallace:,10:51,9/29/20,10,51,0:10:51,0:09:31,0:09:31,"Mr. President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare."
President Donal...:,11:05,9/29/20,11,5,0:11:05,0:09:45,0:09:45,That's right.
Chris Wallace:,11:05,9/29/20,11,5,0:11:05,0:09:45,0:09:45,You have spent the last week-
President Donal...:,11:07,9/29/20,11,7,0:11:07,0:09:47,0:09:47,Because they want to give good healthcare.
Chris Wallace:,11:08,9/29/20,11,8,0:11:08,0:09:48,0:09:48,"If I may ask my question, sir."
Vice President ...:,11:11,9/29/20,11,11,0:11:11,0:09:51,0:09:51,Good healthcare.
Chris Wallace:,11:11,9/29/20,11,11,0:11:11,0:09:51,0:09:51,"Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare."
President Donal...:,11:25,9/29/20,11,25,0:11:25,0:10:05,0:10:05,"Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate."
Chris Wallace:,11:26,9/29/20,11,26,0:11:26,0:10:06,0:10:06,[crosstalk 00:11:26] when I finish I'm going to give an opportunity-
President Donal...:,11:28,9/29/20,11,28,0:11:28,0:10:08,0:10:08,"Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare."
Chris Wallace:,11:31,9/29/20,11,31,0:11:31,0:10:11,0:10:11,That's not a comprehensive place.
President Donal...:,11:32,9/29/20,11,32,0:11:32,0:10:12,0:10:12,That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare.
Chris Wallace:,11:35,9/29/20,11,35,0:11:35,0:10:15,0:10:15,"I didn't ask, sir."
President Donal...:,11:36,9/29/20,11,36,0:11:36,0:10:16,0:10:16,"Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare."
Chris Wallace:,11:38,9/29/20,11,38,0:11:38,0:10:18,0:10:18,You're debating him not me. Let me ask my question.
President Donal...:,11:38,9/29/20,11,38,0:11:38,0:10:18,0:10:18,"Well, I'll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare."
Chris Wallace:,11:44,9/29/20,11,44,0:11:44,0:10:24,0:10:24,Mr. President.
President Donal...:,11:44,9/29/20,11,44,0:11:44,0:10:24,0:10:24,I got rid of it. And we will protect people.
Chris Wallace:,11:46,9/29/20,11,46,0:11:46,0:10:26,0:10:26,"Mr. President, I'm the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer."
President Donal...:,11:52,9/29/20,11,52,0:11:52,0:10:32,0:10:32,Go ahead.
Chris Wallace:,11:53,9/29/20,11,53,0:11:53,0:10:33,0:10:33,"You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?"
President Donal...:,12:16,9/29/20,12,16,0:12:16,0:10:56,0:10:56,"Well, first of all, I guess I'm debating you, not him, but that's okay. I'm not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There's nothing symbolic. I'm cutting drug prices. I'm going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you're going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn't do it. Nobody's done it. So we're cutting healthcare."
Chris Wallace:,12:40,9/29/20,12,40,0:12:40,0:11:20,0:11:20,What about pre-existing conditions?
President Donal...:,12:40,9/29/20,12,40,0:12:40,0:11:20,0:11:20,All of the things that we've done.
Vice President ...:,12:41,9/29/20,12,41,0:12:41,0:11:21,0:11:21,He has not done healthcare.
President Donal...:,12:42,9/29/20,12,42,0:12:42,0:11:22,0:11:22,"I'll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I'm getting it for so cheap it's like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we're doing. Prescription drug prices, we're going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do."
Chris Wallace:,13:03,9/29/20,13,3,0:13:03,0:11:43,0:11:43,"Okay, like I say, this is open discussion."
President Donal...:,13:04,9/29/20,13,4,0:13:04,0:11:44,0:11:44,This is big stuff.
Chris Wallace:,13:06,9/29/20,13,6,0:13:06,0:11:46,0:11:46,"Sir, you'll be happy. I'm about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare."
Vice President ...:,13:17,9/29/20,13,17,0:13:17,0:11:57,0:11:57,Yes.
Chris Wallace:,13:17,9/29/20,13,17,0:13:17,0:11:57,0:11:57,And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance.
Vice President ...:,13:23,9/29/20,13,23,0:13:23,0:12:03,0:12:03,It is not.
Chris Wallace:,13:25,9/29/20,13,25,0:13:25,0:12:05,0:12:05,If I start asking the question.
President Donal...:,13:26,9/29/20,13,26,0:13:26,0:12:06,0:12:06,"That's not what your party says, by the way."
Chris Wallace:,13:29,9/29/20,13,29,0:13:29,0:12:09,0:12:09,And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health.
Vice President ...:,13:32,9/29/20,13,32,0:13:32,0:12:12,0:12:12,"It does not. It's only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two."
President Donal...:,13:57,9/29/20,13,57,0:13:57,0:12:37,0:12:37,"Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who's far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine."
Vice President ...:,14:04,9/29/20,14,4,0:14:04,0:12:44,0:12:44,"Look, hey."
President Donal...:,14:05,9/29/20,14,5,0:14:05,0:12:45,0:12:45,Are you saying you didn't agree?
Vice President ...:,14:06,9/29/20,14,6,0:14:06,0:12:46,0:12:46,I'm not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders.
President Donal...:,14:10,9/29/20,14,10,0:14:10,0:12:50,0:12:50,Not by much.
Vice President ...:,14:10,9/29/20,14,10,0:14:10,0:12:50,0:12:50,I beat him by a whole hell of a lot.
President Donal...:,14:12,9/29/20,14,12,0:14:12,0:12:52,0:12:52,Not by much.
Vice President ...:,14:12,9/29/20,14,12,0:14:12,0:12:52,0:12:52,"I'm here standing facing you, old buddy."
President Donal...:,14:14,9/29/20,14,14,0:14:14,0:12:54,0:12:54,If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary.
Vice President ...:,14:17,9/29/20,14,17,0:14:17,0:12:57,0:12:57,All he knows how to do-
President Donal...:,14:18,9/29/20,14,18,0:14:18,0:12:58,0:12:58,"On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky."
Vice President ...:,14:21,9/29/20,14,21,0:14:21,0:13:01,0:13:01,Look he's the deal. I got very lucky. I'm going to get very lucky tonight as well.
President Donal...:,14:23,9/29/20,14,23,0:14:23,0:13:03,0:13:03,With what?
Vice President ...:,14:23,9/29/20,14,23,0:14:23,0:13:03,0:13:03,And tonight I'm going to make sure.
President Donal...:,14:25,9/29/20,14,25,0:14:25,0:13:05,0:13:05,With what?
Vice President ...:,14:25,9/29/20,14,25,0:14:25,0:13:05,0:13:05,"Because here's the deal, here's the deal. The fact is that everything he's saying so far is simply a lie. I'm not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he's a liar."
President Donal...:,14:34,9/29/20,14,34,0:14:34,0:13:14,0:13:14,"But you agree. Joe, you're the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class."
Vice President ...:,14:41,9/29/20,14,41,0:14:41,0:13:21,0:13:21,"God, I want to make sure-"
Chris Wallace:,14:43,9/29/20,14,43,0:14:43,0:13:23,0:13:23,"Mr. President, can you let him finish, sir?"
Vice President ...:,14:44,9/29/20,14,44,0:14:44,0:13:24,0:13:24,"No, he doesn't know how to do that."
President Donal...:,14:46,9/29/20,14,46,0:14:46,0:13:26,0:13:26,"You'd be surprised. You'd be surprised. Go ahead, Joe."
Vice President ...:,14:47,9/29/20,14,47,0:14:47,0:13:27,0:13:27,"The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time."
President Donal...:,14:51,9/29/20,14,51,0:14:51,0:13:31,0:13:31,"Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto."
Vice President ...:,14:55,9/29/20,14,55,0:14:55,0:13:35,0:13:35,"There is no manifesto, number one."
Chris Wallace:,14:57,9/29/20,14,57,0:14:57,0:13:37,0:13:37,"Please let him speak, Mr. President."
Vice President ...:,14:58,9/29/20,14,58,0:14:58,0:13:38,0:13:38,Number two.
President Donal...:,14:58,9/29/20,14,58,0:14:58,0:13:38,0:13:38,He just lost the left.
Vice President ...:,14:59,9/29/20,14,59,0:14:59,0:13:39,0:13:39,Number two.
President Donal...:,15:01,9/29/20,15,1,0:15:01,0:13:41,0:13:41,"You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan [crosstalk 00:15:10], they call it socialized medicine."
Chris Wallace:,15:13,9/29/20,15,13,0:15:13,0:13:53,0:13:53,Mr. President.
Vice President ...:,15:14,9/29/20,15,14,0:15:14,0:13:54,0:13:54,"I'll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare."
President Donal...:,15:20,9/29/20,15,20,0:15:20,0:14:00,0:14:00,"Who is, Bernie?"
Vice President ...:,15:21,9/29/20,15,21,0:15:21,0:14:01,0:14:01,"Because he, in fact, already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won't ever look you in the eye and say that's what he wants to do. Take it away."
President Donal...:,15:41,9/29/20,15,41,0:15:41,0:14:21,0:14:21,"No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good."
Vice President ...:,15:45,9/29/20,15,45,0:15:45,0:14:25,0:14:25,He doesn't know how. He doesn't know how to do that.
President Donal...:,15:46,9/29/20,15,46,0:15:46,0:14:26,0:14:26,I've already fixed it.
Vice President ...:,15:47,9/29/20,15,47,0:15:47,0:14:27,0:14:27,He has never offered a plan.
President Donal...:,15:49,9/29/20,15,49,0:15:49,0:14:29,0:14:29,"We've already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don't, Obamacare is no good."
Chris Wallace:,15:54,9/29/20,15,54,0:15:54,0:14:34,0:14:34,"Gentlemen, you realize if you're both speaking at the same time. Let the President. Go ahead, sir."
President Donal...:,15:59,9/29/20,15,59,0:15:59,0:14:39,0:14:39,"Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed ... They shouldn't even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they'll probably blame him, but they'll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, ""You've got to run it so well."" And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it's a disaster. It's too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn't work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that's cheaper and better."
Chris Wallace:,16:42,9/29/20,16,42,0:16:42,0:15:22,0:15:22,"I understand that, sir. But I have to give you roughly equal time."
President Donal...:,16:45,9/29/20,16,45,0:16:45,0:15:25,0:15:25,Go ahead.
Chris Wallace:,16:45,9/29/20,16,45,0:16:45,0:15:25,0:15:25,"Please let the Vice President talk, sir."
President Donal...:,16:47,9/29/20,16,47,0:16:47,0:15:27,0:15:27,Good.
Vice President ...:,16:48,9/29/20,16,48,0:16:48,0:15:28,0:15:28,He has no plan for healthcare.
President Donal...:,16:50,9/29/20,16,50,0:16:50,0:15:30,0:15:30,"Of course, we do."
Chris Wallace:,16:52,9/29/20,16,52,0:16:52,0:15:32,0:15:32,Please.
Vice President ...:,16:52,9/29/20,16,52,0:16:52,0:15:32,0:15:32,"He sends out wishful thinking. He has Executive Orders that have no power. He hasn't lowered drug costs for anybody. He's been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected. He has none, like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn't have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn't know what he's talking about. [crosstalk 00:17:14]."
Chris Wallace:,17:13,9/29/20,17,13,0:17:13,0:15:53,0:15:53,"All right, I have one final question for you."
Vice President ...:,17:15,9/29/20,17,15,0:17:15,0:15:55,0:15:55,Sure.
Chris Wallace:,17:16,9/29/20,17,16,0:17:16,0:15:56,0:15:56,"Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans, we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here, if Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the President. But, in fact, it wasn't brought up by the President. It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress. So my question to you is, you have refused in the past to talk about it, are you willing to tell the American tonight whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court?"
Vice President ...:,17:55,9/29/20,17,55,0:17:55,0:16:35,0:16:35,"Whatever position I take on that, that'll become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. You're voting now. Vote and let your Senators know strongly how you feel."
President Donal...:,18:05,9/29/20,18,5,0:18:05,0:16:45,0:16:45,Are you going to pack the court?
Vice President ...:,18:07,9/29/20,18,7,0:18:07,0:16:47,0:16:47,Vote now.
President Donal...:,18:08,9/29/20,18,8,0:18:08,0:16:48,0:16:48,Are you going to pack the court?
Vice President ...:,18:09,9/29/20,18,9,0:18:09,0:16:49,0:16:49,"Make sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators."
President Donal...:,18:12,9/29/20,18,12,0:18:12,0:16:52,0:16:52,He doesn't want to answer the question.
Vice President ...:,18:17,9/29/20,18,17,0:18:17,0:16:57,0:16:57,I'm not going to answer the question.
President Donal...:,18:18,9/29/20,18,18,0:18:18,0:16:58,0:16:58,Why wouldn't you answer that question? You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices. Radical left.
Vice President ...:,18:18,9/29/20,18,18,0:18:18,0:16:58,0:16:58,"Will you shut up, man?"
President Donal...:,18:20,9/29/20,18,20,0:18:20,0:17:00,0:17:00,"Listen, who is on your list, Joe? Who's on your list?"
Chris Wallace:,18:23,9/29/20,18,23,0:18:23,0:17:03,0:17:03,"Gentlemen, I think we've ended this-"
Vice President ...:,18:25,9/29/20,18,25,0:18:25,0:17:05,0:17:05,This is so un-Presidential.
President Donal...:,18:25,9/29/20,18,25,0:18:25,0:17:05,0:17:05,He's going to pack the court. He is not going to give a list.
Chris Wallace:,18:27,9/29/20,18,27,0:18:27,0:17:07,0:17:07,We have ended the segment. We're going to move on to the second segment.
Vice President ...:,18:30,9/29/20,18,30,0:18:30,0:17:10,0:17:10,"That was really a productive segment, wasn't it? Keep yapping, man."
President Donal...:,18:35,9/29/20,18,35,0:18:35,0:17:15,0:17:15,"The people understand, Joe."
Vice President ...:,18:37,9/29/20,18,37,0:18:37,0:17:17,0:17:17,They sure do.
President Donal...:,18:37,9/29/20,18,37,0:18:37,0:17:17,0:17:17,"47 years, you've done nothing. They're understand."
Chris Wallace:,18:40,9/29/20,18,40,0:18:40,0:17:20,0:17:20,"All right, the second subject is COVID-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So let's try to be serious about it. We have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is, based on what you have said and done so far, and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward? In this case, the question goes to you first, sir. Two minutes, uninterrupted."
Vice President ...:,19:33,9/29/20,19,33,0:19:33,0:18:13,0:18:13,"Good luck. 200,000 dead. As you said, over seven million infected in the United States. We, in fact, have 4% of the world's population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said, ""It is what it is."" Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. That's why it is. The President has no plan. He hasn't laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He's on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn't tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn't want to panic the American people. You don't panic. He panicked. In addition to that, what did he do?"
Vice President ...:,20:30,9/29/20,20,30,0:20:30,0:19:10,0:19:10,He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that.
President Donal...:,20:43,9/29/20,20,43,0:20:43,0:19:23,0:19:23,Wrong.
Vice President ...:,20:43,9/29/20,20,43,0:20:43,0:19:23,0:19:23,He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing. He waited and waited and waited. He still doesn't have a plan.
President Donal...:,20:57,9/29/20,20,57,0:20:57,0:19:37,0:19:37,Wrong.
Chris Wallace:,20:57,9/29/20,20,57,0:20:57,0:19:37,0:19:37,"Sir, it's his two minutes."
President Donal...:,20:57,9/29/20,20,57,0:20:57,0:19:37,0:19:37,It's so wrong.
Vice President ...:,20:57,9/29/20,20,57,0:20:57,0:19:37,0:19:37,"I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives."
President Donal...:,21:30,9/29/20,21,30,0:21:30,0:20:10,0:20:10,"So, if we would have listened to you."
Chris Wallace:,21:31,9/29/20,21,31,0:21:31,0:20:11,0:20:11,"Wait, wait. You have two minutes, sir."
President Donal...:,21:31,9/29/20,21,31,0:21:31,0:20:11,0:20:11,"If we would've listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. It's China's fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China's fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don't know how many people died in China. You don't know how many people died in Russia. You don't know how many people died in India. They don't exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we've done, I closed it and you said, ""He's xenophobic. He's a racist and he's xenophobic,"" because you didn't think I should have closed our country. Wait a minute."
Chris Wallace:,22:06,9/29/20,22,6,0:22:06,0:20:46,0:20:46,"Sir, it's his two minutes."
President Donal...:,22:07,9/29/20,22,7,0:22:07,0:20:47,0:20:47,"You didn't think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldn't have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, ""President Trump saved thousands of lives."" Many of your Democrat Governors said, ""President Trump did a phenomenal job."" We worked with the Governor. Oh really, go take a look. The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, ""President Trump did a phenomenal job."" We did. We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldn't have made ventilators. And now we're weeks away from a vaccine. We're doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We've done a great job."
President Donal...:,22:54,9/29/20,22,54,0:22:54,0:21:34,0:21:34,"The only thing I haven't done a good job, and that's because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. It's just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that's the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I don't care. I've gotten used to it. But I'll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don't have it in your blood. You could've never done that, Joe."
Vice President ...:,23:15,9/29/20,23,15,0:23:15,0:21:55,0:21:55,I know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done.
President Donal...:,23:18,9/29/20,23,18,0:23:18,0:21:58,0:21:58,"Well, you didn't do very well in Swine Flu. H1-N1, you were a disaster. Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster."
Vice President ...:,23:25,9/29/20,23,25,0:23:25,0:22:05,0:22:05,"14,000 people died, not 200,000."
President Donal...:,23:27,9/29/20,23,27,0:23:27,0:22:07,0:22:07,"A far less lethal disease, by the way."
Chris Wallace:,23:32,9/29/20,23,32,0:23:32,0:22:12,0:22:12,"Sir, you made a point. Let him answer it."
Vice President ...:,23:33,9/29/20,23,33,0:23:33,0:22:13,0:22:13,"And there was no one ... We didn't shut down the economy. This is his economy he shut down. The reason it's shut down is because, look, you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn't even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye?"
President Donal...:,23:57,9/29/20,23,57,0:23:57,0:22:37,0:22:37,"We would have lost far more people, far more people. You would have been months late. You're months behind me, Joe."
Vice President ...:,0:24:03,9/29/20,,,0:24:03,0:22:43,0:22:43,"His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year. And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we're for a vaccine, but I don't trust him at all. Nor do you. I know you don't. What we trust is a scientist."
President Donal...:,0:24:25,9/29/20,,,0:24:25,0:23:05,0:23:05,"You don't trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?"
Chris Wallace:,0:24:30,9/29/20,,,0:24:30,0:23:10,0:23:10,"Okay, gentlemen, gentlemen. Let me move on to questions about the future because you both have touched on two of the questions I'm going to ask. Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your governments own top scientists. The week before last, the Head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those were your two words. But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your Operation Warp Speed, has said exactly the same thing. Are they both wrong?"
President Donal...:,0:00:15,9/29/20,,,0:25:15,0:23:55,0:23:55,"Well, I've spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. It's a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives."
Vice President ...:,0:00:22,9/29/20,,,0:25:22,0:24:02,0:24:02,God.
President Donal...:,0:00:23,9/29/20,,,0:25:23,0:24:03,0:24:03,"It is a very political thing. I've spoken to Pfizer, I've spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by a lot. It's become very political because the left... Or I don't know if I call them left, I don't know what I call them."
Chris Wallace:,0:00:38,9/29/20,,,0:25:38,0:24:18,0:24:18,"So you're suggesting that the head of your Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Slaoui-"
President Donal...:,0:00:42,9/29/20,,,0:25:42,0:24:22,0:24:22,"I disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn't say that. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. I had him in my office two days ago."
Chris Wallace:,0:00:49,9/29/20,,,0:25:49,0:24:29,0:24:29,"He talked about the summer, sir, before it's generally available, just like Dr. Redfield."
President Donal...:,0:00:53,9/29/20,,,0:25:53,0:24:33,0:24:33,Because he said it's a possibility that we'll have the answer before November 1st. It could also be after that.
Chris Wallace:,0:00:59,9/29/20,,,0:25:59,0:24:39,0:24:39,"I'm talking about when it's generally available, not-"
President Donal...:,0:01:00,9/29/20,,,0:26:00,0:24:40,0:24:40,"Well, we're going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically, they're all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day. They're going to be delivering-"
Vice President ...:,0:01:11,9/29/20,,,0:26:11,0:24:51,0:24:51,This is the same man who told you-
President Donal...:,0:01:13,9/29/20,,,0:26:13,0:24:53,0:24:53,It's all set up.
Vice President ...:,0:01:14,9/29/20,,,0:26:14,0:24:54,0:24:54,"... by Easter, this would be gone away. By the warm weather, it'd be gone. Miraculous, like a miracle. And by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm, and that would take care of it. This is the same man."
President Donal...:,0:01:24,9/29/20,,,0:26:24,0:25:04,0:25:04,"That was said sarcastically, and you know that. That was said sarcastically."
Vice President ...:,0:01:28,9/29/20,,,0:26:28,0:25:08,0:25:08,"So here's the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine. And pray God we will. Pray God we will."
Chris Wallace:,0:01:49,9/29/20,,,0:26:49,0:25:29,0:25:29,"Mr. Vice President, I want to pick up-"
President Donal...:,0:01:50,9/29/20,,,0:26:50,0:25:30,0:25:30,You'll have the vaccine sooner than that.
Chris Wallace:,0:01:51,9/29/20,,,0:26:51,0:25:31,0:25:31,"I want to pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can't trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts quote, ""Will be muzzled, will be suppressed."" Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate, Senator Harris, contributing to that fear?"
Vice President ...:,0:02:18,9/29/20,,,0:27:18,0:25:58,0:25:58,No more than the question you just asked him. You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists.
Chris Wallace:,0:02:25,9/29/20,,,0:27:25,0:26:05,0:26:05,But you're saying you can't-
Vice President ...:,0:02:26,9/29/20,,,0:27:26,0:26:06,0:26:06,Everybody knows-
Chris Wallace:,0:02:26,9/29/20,,,0:27:26,0:26:06,0:26:06,Or Senator Harris is saying you can't trust the scientist.
Vice President ...:,0:02:28,9/29/20,,,0:27:28,0:26:08,0:26:08,"Well, no, no. You can trust the scientist. She didn't say that. You can trust the-"
Chris Wallace:,0:02:32,9/29/20,,,0:27:32,0:26:12,0:26:12,"She said that public health experts quote, ""Will be muzzled, will be suppressed."""
Vice President ...:,0:02:36,9/29/20,,,0:27:36,0:26:16,0:26:16,"Yes. Well, that's what he's going to try to do, but there's thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital that don't work for him. Their job doesn't depend on him. They're the people... And by the way-"
President Donal...:,0:02:51,9/29/20,,,0:27:51,0:26:31,0:26:31,We spoke to the scientists that are in charge-
Vice President ...:,0:02:53,9/29/20,,,0:27:53,0:26:33,0:26:33,By the way-
President Donal...:,0:02:53,9/29/20,,,0:27:53,0:26:33,0:26:33,... they will have the vaccine very soon.
Chris Wallace:,0:02:55,9/29/20,,,0:27:55,0:26:35,0:26:35,Let him finish.
Vice President ...:,0:02:55,9/29/20,,,0:27:55,0:26:35,0:26:35,"Do you believe for a moment what he's telling you in light of all the lies he's told you about the whole issue relating to COVID? He still hasn't even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn't even tell you. He's on record as saying it. He panicked or he just looked at the stock market. One of the two. Because guess what? A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker-"
Chris Wallace:,0:03:27,9/29/20,,,0:28:27,0:27:07,0:27:07,Mr. President?
President Donal...:,0:03:28,9/29/20,,,0:28:28,0:27:08,0:27:08,"Did you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn't go to Delaware State. You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don't ever use the word smart with me. Don't ever use that word."
Vice President ...:,0:03:44,9/29/20,,,0:28:44,0:27:24,0:27:24,"Oh, give me a break."
President Donal...:,0:03:44,9/29/20,,,0:28:44,0:27:24,0:27:24,"Because you know what? There's nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years you've done nothing."
Vice President ...:,0:03:49,9/29/20,,,0:28:49,0:27:29,0:27:29,"Well, let's have this debate-"
President Donal...:,0:03:51,9/29/20,,,0:28:51,0:27:31,0:27:31,"Let me just tell you something, Joe. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country. And by the way, now it's being built again and it's going up fast."
Chris Wallace:,0:04:02,9/29/20,,,0:29:02,0:27:42,0:27:42,"We'll get to the economy in the next segment, sir."
President Donal...:,0:04:04,9/29/20,,,0:29:04,0:27:44,0:27:44,Okay. It's going up fast. I look forward to talking about it.
Chris Wallace:,0:04:06,9/29/20,,,0:29:06,0:27:46,0:27:46,"Okay. When it comes to how the virus has been handled so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those. Reopenings. Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and schools. Why, sir?"
Vice President ...:,0:04:31,9/29/20,,,0:29:31,0:28:11,0:28:11,"Because he doesn't have a plan. If I were running it, I'd know what the plan is. You've got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need. You have to provide them classic-"
President Donal...:,0:04:45,9/29/20,,,0:29:45,0:28:25,0:28:25,Tell that to Nancy Pelosi.
Vice President ...:,0:04:47,9/29/20,,,0:29:47,0:28:27,0:28:27,Will he just shush for a minute?
President Donal...:,0:04:49,9/29/20,,,0:29:49,0:28:29,0:28:29,"Tell that to Nancy Pelosi, and Schumer [crosstalk 00:04:52] Chuck."
Vice President ...:,0:04:52,9/29/20,,,0:29:52,0:28:32,0:28:32,"Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, they have a plan. He won't even meet with them. The Republicans won't meet in the Senate. He sits in his golf course. Well, I mean, literally, think about it. Think about it."
President Donal...:,0:05:04,9/29/20,,,0:30:04,0:28:44,0:28:44,"You probably play more than I do, Joe."
Chris Wallace:,0:05:06,9/29/20,,,0:30:06,0:28:46,0:28:46,What about this question of reopenings and the fact-
President Donal...:,0:05:08,9/29/20,,,0:30:08,0:28:48,0:28:48,"Well, he wants to shut down this country and I want to keep it open, and we did a great thing by shutting it down-"
Vice President ...:,0:05:15,9/29/20,,,0:30:15,0:28:55,0:28:55,You just admitted you'd shut it down.
President Donal...:,0:05:15,9/29/20,,,0:30:15,0:28:55,0:28:55,"Wait a minute, Joe. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. He wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to, because we didn't know anything about the disease. Now we've found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot. Young children aren't, even younger people aren't. We've learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd."
Chris Wallace:,0:05:54,9/29/20,,,0:30:54,0:29:34,0:29:34,All right. I want to move onto another-
President Donal...:,0:05:55,9/29/20,,,0:30:55,0:29:35,0:29:35,Because it's a political thing.
Chris Wallace:,0:05:55,9/29/20,,,0:30:55,0:29:35,0:29:35,I want to move onto another subject.
Vice President ...:,0:05:55,9/29/20,,,0:30:55,0:29:35,0:29:35,I got to respond to that.
Chris Wallace:,0:05:55,9/29/20,,,0:30:55,0:29:35,0:29:35,I want to move-
President Donal...:,0:05:57,9/29/20,,,0:30:57,0:29:37,0:29:37,But those states-
Chris Wallace:,0:05:58,9/29/20,,,0:30:58,0:29:38,0:29:38,"Gentlemen, I want to move onto another subject."
President Donal...:,0:06:00,9/29/20,,,0:31:00,0:29:40,0:29:40,Those states are not doing well that are shut down right now.
Vice President ...:,0:06:02,9/29/20,,,0:31:02,0:29:42,0:29:42,I got to respond to that.
President Donal...:,0:06:04,9/29/20,,,0:31:04,0:29:44,0:29:44,He wants to shut down the whole country.
Chris Wallace:,0:06:04,9/29/20,,,0:31:04,0:29:44,0:29:44,"President Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer. And in fact, recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. Are you questioning the efficacy of masks?"
President Donal...:,0:06:20,9/29/20,,,0:31:20,0:30:00,0:30:00,"No, I think masks are okay. You have to understand, if you look... I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it. Tonight, as an example, everybody's had a test and you've had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks-"
Vice President ...:,0:06:33,9/29/20,,,0:31:33,0:30:13,0:30:13,Just like your rally.
President Donal...:,0:06:33,9/29/20,,,0:31:33,0:30:13,0:30:13,"... when needed. When needed, I wear masks."
Chris Wallace:,0:06:35,9/29/20,,,0:31:35,0:30:15,0:30:15,Okay. Let me ask-
President Donal...:,0:06:36,9/29/20,,,0:31:36,0:30:16,0:30:16,"I don't wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he's got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I've ever seen. I will say this-"
Chris Wallace:,0:06:45,9/29/20,,,0:31:45,0:30:25,0:30:25,"Vice President Biden, go ahead, sir."
Vice President ...:,0:06:48,9/29/20,,,0:31:48,0:30:28,0:30:28,"Look, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able open. We provided money, the-"
Chris Wallace:,0:06:55,9/29/20,,,0:31:55,0:30:35,0:30:35,"But I was asking you, sir, about masks."
Vice President ...:,0:06:56,9/29/20,,,0:31:56,0:30:36,0:30:36,"Well, masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we'd probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters. It matters."
President Donal...:,0:07:10,9/29/20,,,0:32:10,0:30:50,0:30:50,And they've also said the opposite. They've also said-
Vice President ...:,0:07:12,9/29/20,,,0:32:12,0:30:52,0:30:52,No serious person has said the opposite. No serious person.
Chris Wallace:,0:07:14,9/29/20,,,0:32:14,0:30:54,0:30:54,Okay. I want to ask you-
President Donal...:,0:07:17,9/29/20,,,0:32:17,0:30:57,0:30:57,Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci said the opposite.
Vice President ...:,0:07:18,9/29/20,,,0:32:18,0:30:58,0:30:58,He did not say the opposite.
Chris Wallace:,0:07:19,9/29/20,,,0:32:19,0:30:59,0:30:59,"I want to ask you, we've got a little than a minute left in this segment."
President Donal...:,0:07:22,9/29/20,,,0:32:22,0:31:02,0:31:02,"He said very strongly, ""Masks are not good."" Then he changed his mind. He said, ""Masks are good."""
Chris Wallace:,0:07:25,9/29/20,,,0:32:25,0:31:05,0:31:05,I want to ask-
President Donal...:,0:07:25,9/29/20,,,0:32:25,0:31:05,0:31:05,I'm okay with masks. I'm not fighting masks.
Chris Wallace:,0:07:27,9/29/20,,,0:32:27,0:31:07,0:31:07,"I want to ask you both about one last subject because your different approaches has even affected the way that you have campaigned. President Trump, you're holding large rallies with crowds packed together, thousands of people."
President Donal...:,0:07:38,9/29/20,,,0:32:38,0:31:18,0:31:18,Outside.
Chris Wallace:,0:07:39,9/29/20,,,0:32:39,0:31:19,0:31:19,"Outside. Yes, sir. Agreed. Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with-"
President Donal...:,0:07:46,9/29/20,,,0:32:46,0:31:26,0:31:26,Because nobody will show up.
Chris Wallace:,0:07:47,9/29/20,,,0:32:47,0:31:27,0:31:27,... people with masks.
President Donal...:,0:07:47,9/29/20,,,0:32:47,0:31:27,0:31:27,"Well, it's true. Nobody shows up to his rallies."
Chris Wallace:,0:07:50,9/29/20,,,0:32:50,0:31:30,0:31:30,"All right. In any case, why you holding the big rallies? Why you not? You go first, sir."
President Donal...:,0:07:56,9/29/20,,,0:32:56,0:31:36,0:31:36,Because people want to hear what I have to say. I mean-
Chris Wallace:,0:07:59,9/29/20,,,0:32:59,0:31:39,0:31:39,But are not worried about us spreading disease?
President Donal...:,0:08:01,9/29/20,,,0:33:01,0:31:41,0:31:41,"... I'm doing my job as a president, and I'll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people-"
Chris Wallace:,0:08:06,9/29/20,,,0:33:06,0:31:46,0:31:46,"Are you not worried about the disease issues, sir?"
President Donal...:,0:08:08,9/29/20,,,0:33:08,0:31:48,0:31:48,"Well, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It's outside. That's a big difference according to the experts. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace."
Vice President ...:,0:08:26,9/29/20,,,0:33:26,0:32:06,0:32:06,"By the way, did you see one of the last big rallies he had? A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, ""No, no, no. Stand back, put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I'm way far away from those other people."" That's what he said, ""I'm going to be okay."" He's not worried about you. He's not worried about the people out there [crosstalk 00:08:48]."
President Donal...:,0:08:48,9/29/20,,,0:33:48,0:32:28,0:32:28,We've had no negative effect.
Vice President ...:,0:08:49,9/29/20,,,0:33:49,0:32:29,0:32:29,No negative effect. Come on.
President Donal...:,0:08:51,9/29/20,,,0:33:51,0:32:31,0:32:31,"We've had no negative effect, and we've had 35, 40,000 people at these rallies."
Chris Wallace:,0:08:55,9/29/20,,,0:33:55,0:32:35,0:32:35,All right. Do you want to just quickly finish up? Because I want to move on to our next-
Vice President ...:,0:08:57,9/29/20,,,0:33:57,0:32:37,0:32:37,"Yes, I would. He's been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. He's a fool on this."
President Donal...:,0:09:08,9/29/20,,,0:34:08,0:32:48,0:32:48,"If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing. But you can't. Nobody cares."
Chris Wallace:,0:09:12,9/29/20,,,0:34:12,0:32:52,0:32:52,"Gentlemen, can we move on to the-"
President Donal...:,0:09:13,9/29/20,,,0:34:13,0:32:53,0:32:53,No cares.
Chris Wallace:,0:09:13,9/29/20,,,0:34:13,0:32:53,0:32:53,"Gentlemen, can we move on to the economy?"
President Donal...:,0:09:15,9/29/20,,,0:34:15,0:32:55,0:32:55,Yes.
Chris Wallace:,0:09:15,9/29/20,,,0:34:15,0:32:55,0:32:55,"The economy is, I think it's fair to say, recovering faster than expected from the shutdown-"
President Donal...:,0:09:22,9/29/20,,,0:34:22,0:33:02,0:33:02,Much faster.
Chris Wallace:,0:09:22,9/29/20,,,0:34:22,0:33:02,0:33:02,"... in the second quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month. The Federal Reserve says the hit to growth, which is going to be there, is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected. President Trump, you say we are in a V-shaped recovery. Vice President Biden, you say it's more of a K-shape. What difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy? President Trump, in this segment you go first."
President Donal...:,0:09:52,9/29/20,,,0:34:52,0:33:32,0:33:32,"So we built the greatest economy in history. We closed it down because of the China plague. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. He didn't think we should close it down and he was wrong. Again, two million people would be dead now instead of... Still, 204,000 people is too much. One person is too much. Should have never happened from China. But what happened is we closed it down and now we're reopening and we're doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we've put back into the workforce. That's a record the likes of which nobody's ever seen before. And he wants to close down the... He will shut it down again. He will destroy this country."
President Donal...:,0:10:31,9/29/20,,,0:35:31,0:34:11,0:34:11,"A lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what's happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns. And I'm telling you it's because they don't want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, ""Oh, we're going to open up on November 9th."" Why November 9th? Because it's after the election. They think they're hurting us by keeping them closed. They're hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up."
President Donal...:,0:11:04,9/29/20,,,0:36:04,0:34:44,0:34:44,"When you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up. It's not fair. You're talking about almost it's like being in prison. And you look at what's going on with divorce, look at what's going on with alcoholism and drugs. It's a very, very sad thing. And he'll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don't need somebody to come in and say, ""Let's shut it down."""
Chris Wallace:,0:11:36,9/29/20,,,0:36:36,0:35:16,0:35:16,"All right. Your two minutes, sir. We're now moved to you. As I said, posing the question, the president says it's a V-shape recovery, you say it's a K-shaped recovery. What's the difference?"
Vice President ...:,0:11:48,9/29/20,,,0:36:48,0:35:28,0:35:28,"The difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the COVID crisis have done very well. Billionaires have made another $300 billion because of his profligate tax proposal, and he only focused on the market. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in America, how well are you doing? This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes."
President Donal...:,0:12:17,9/29/20,,,0:37:17,0:35:57,0:35:57,That's wrong.

Chris Wallace:,0:12:20,9/29/20,,,0:37:20,0:36:00,0:36:00,"Yeah, I understand. You've agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have it."
Vice President ...:,0:12:23,9/29/20,,,0:37:23,0:36:03,0:36:03,"Do I get my time back? The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he's going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. First one in American history."
Vice President ...:,0:12:40,9/29/20,,,0:37:40,0:36:20,0:36:20,"Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines. Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying. People who've been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why is he want to open it up? Why does he take care of the... You can't fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis. And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety."
Vice President ...:,0:13:25,9/29/20,,,0:38:25,0:37:05,0:37:05,"Schools. Why aren't schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. They were going to give, his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn't do that because it's not a national emergency. Not a national emergency. They've done nothing to help small businesses. Nothing. They're closing. One in six is now gone.

President Donal...:,0:22:56,9/29/20,,,0:47:56,0:46:36,0:46:36,It's a fact.
Vice President ...:,0:22:57,9/29/20,,,0:47:57,0:46:37,0:46:37,It is not a fact.
Chris Wallace:,0:22:57,9/29/20,,,0:47:57,0:46:37,0:46:37,"Well, you have raised an issue, let the Vice President answer."
Vice President ...:,0:23:00,9/29/20,,,0:48:00,0:46:40,0:46:40,It's been totally discredited.

Vice President ...:,0:23:47,9/29/20,,,0:48:47,0:47:27,0:47:27,I did it honorably.

Vice President ...:,0:24:09,9/29/20,,,0:49:09,0:47:49,0:47:49,"Look, here's the deal. We want to talk about families and ethics. I don't want to do that. I mean, his family, we could talk about all night. His family's already-"

Chris Wallace:,0:24:43,9/29/20,,,0:49:43,0:48:23,0:48:23,That's the end of the segment. We're moving on.
Vice President ...:,0:24:46,9/29/20,,,0:49:46,0:48:26,0:48:26,He didn't take that.

Vice President ...:,0:24:49,9/29/20,,,0:49:49,0:48:29,0:48:29,Try to be honest.
Chris Wallace:,0:24:50,9/29/20,,,0:49:50,0:48:30,0:48:30,No.
President Donal...:,0:24:50,9/29/20,,,0:49:50,0:48:30,0:48:30,He stood up-
Chris Wallace:,0:24:52,9/29/20,,,0:49:52,0:48:32,0:48:32,The answer to the question is no.

Vice President ...:,0:24:57,9/29/20,,,0:49:57,0:48:37,0:48:37,That is absolutely not true.
Chris Wallace:,0:25:01,9/29/20,,,0:50:01,0:48:41,0:48:41,"Stop. [crosstalk 00:25:02] Gentlemen, I hate to raise my voice, but I- [crosstalk 00:25:05] Why should I be different than the two of you? So here's the deal."
Vice President ...:,0:25:09,9/29/20,,,0:50:09,0:48:49,0:48:49,That's a good point.
Chris Wallace:,0:25:09,9/29/20,,,0:50:09,0:48:49,0:48:49,"We have six segments. We have ended that segment. We're going to go to the next segment. In that segment, you each are going to have two uninterrupted moments. In those two interrupted minutes, Mr. President, you can say anything you want. I'm going to ask a question about race, but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But I think that the country would be better served, if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I'm appealing to you, sir, to do that."
President Donal...:,0:25:37,9/29/20,,,0:50:37,0:49:17,0:49:17,"Well, and him too."
Chris Wallace:,0:25:38,9/29/20,,,0:50:38,0:49:18,0:49:18,"Well, frankly, you've been doing more interrupting than he has."
President Donal...:,0:25:40,9/29/20,,,0:50:40,0:49:20,0:49:20,"Well, that's all right, but he does plenty."
Chris Wallace:,0:25:41,9/29/20,,,0:50:41,0:49:21,0:49:21,"Well, sir, less than-"
President Donal...:,0:25:43,9/29/20,,,0:50:43,0:49:23,0:49:23,He does plenty.
Chris Wallace:,0:25:43,9/29/20,,,0:50:43,0:49:23,0:49:23,"No, less than you have. Let's please continue on. The issue of rice. Vice-President Biden, you say that President Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president."
President Donal...:,0:26:05,9/29/20,,,0:51:05,0:49:45,0:49:45,"Oh yeah, sure."
Chris Wallace:,0:26:06,9/29/20,,,0:51:06,0:49:46,0:49:46,"President Trump, you have often said that you believe you will have done more for Black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln."
President Donal...:,0:26:16,9/29/20,,,0:51:16,0:49:56,0:49:56,That's true.
Chris Wallace:,0:26:16,9/29/20,,,0:51:16,0:49:56,0:49:56,"My question for the two of you, is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first."
Vice President ...:,0:26:29,9/29/20,,,0:51:29,0:50:09,0:50:09,"It's about equity and equality. It's about decency. It's about the constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we've never accomplished it, but we've never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people... Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought. He said, ""There were very fine people on both sides."" No president's ever said anything like that. [crosstalk 00:27:10]."
Chris Wallace:,0:27:11,9/29/20,,,0:52:11,0:50:51,0:50:51,It is his-
Vice President ...:,0:27:12,9/29/20,,,0:52:12,0:50:52,0:50:52,Now-
Chris Wallace:,0:27:12,9/29/20,,,0:52:12,0:50:52,0:50:52,... minute sir.
Vice President ...:,0:27:13,9/29/20,,,0:52:13,0:50:53,0:50:53,"... second point I'd make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racists hatred, racist division."
Vice President ...:,0:27:50,9/29/20,,,0:52:50,0:51:30,0:51:30,"This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn't do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man is as a savior of African-Americans? This man cares at all? This man's done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community."
President Donal...:,0:28:27,9/29/20,,,0:53:27,0:52:07,0:52:07,So-
Chris Wallace:,0:28:28,9/29/20,,,0:53:28,0:52:08,0:52:08,"President Trump, you have two minutes. Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal race issues?"
President Donal...:,0:28:34,9/29/20,,,0:53:34,0:52:14,0:52:14,"You did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. African-Americans are super predators and they've never forgotten it. They've never forgotten it."
Vice President ...:,0:28:43,9/29/20,,,0:53:43,0:52:23,0:52:23,I've never said-
Chris Wallace:,0:28:44,9/29/20,,,0:53:44,0:52:24,0:52:24,"No, no, sir. It's his two minutes."
President Donal...:,0:28:45,9/29/20,,,0:53:45,0:52:25,0:52:25,"So you did that and they call you a super predator and I'm letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990... And that's why, if you look at the polls, I'm doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super predators, and you've called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you've called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every... Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, ""I support President Trump."""
President Donal...:,0:29:39,9/29/20,,,0:54:39,0:53:19,0:53:19,"I don't think you have any law enforcement. You can't even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you're going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren't you saying those words, Joe? Why don't you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won't do it, because they're run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don't. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they've got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don't want to say anything about law and order. And I'll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you're afraid to even say it."
Chris Wallace:,0:30:35,9/29/20,,,0:55:35,0:54:15,0:54:15,"All right. I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, ""Whether justice could be equally applied in America."" Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for Blacks in this country?"
Vice President ...:,0:30:59,9/29/20,,,0:55:59,0:54:39,0:54:39,"Yes, there is. There's systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it's enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I'm going to do as President of the United States is call together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we're going to work this out."
Vice President ...:,0:31:38,9/29/20,,,0:56:38,0:55:18,0:55:18,"We're going to work this out. So we changed the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don't like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when... And by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate."
Chris Wallace:,0:32:04,9/29/20,,,0:57:04,0:55:44,0:55:44,"All right, Mr.-"
President Donal...:,0:32:05,9/29/20,,,0:57:05,0:55:45,0:55:45,What is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of the town-

Vice President ...:,0:32:11,9/29/20,,,0:57:11,0:55:51,0:55:51,That is not peaceful protest.
President Donal...:,0:32:13,9/29/20,,,0:57:13,0:55:53,0:55:53,"No it's not, but you say it is."
Chris Wallace:,0:32:15,9/29/20,,,0:57:15,0:55:55,0:55:55,"President Trump, I'd like to continue with the issue of race. I promise we're going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment."
President Donal...:,0:32:21,9/29/20,,,0:57:21,0:56:01,0:56:01,Fine.
Chris Wallace:,0:32:21,9/29/20,,,0:57:21,0:56:01,0:56:01,"This month, your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?"
President Donal...:,0:32:42,9/29/20,,,0:57:42,0:56:22,0:56:22,"I ended it because it's racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. And he would know it- [crosstalk 00:33:02]"
Chris Wallace:,0:33:02,9/29/20,,,0:58:02,0:56:42,0:56:42,What is radical about racial sensitivity training?
President Donal...:,0:33:05,9/29/20,,,0:58:05,0:56:45,0:56:45,"If you were a certain person, you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. And really, they were teaching people to hate our country And I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It's a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I'm not going to allow that to happen."
Chris Wallace:,0:33:38,9/29/20,,,0:58:38,0:57:18,0:57:18,Vice President Biden.

Chris Wallace:,0:33:45,9/29/20,,,0:58:45,0:57:25,0:57:25,Let him finish.
Vice President ...:,0:33:47,9/29/20,,,0:58:47,0:57:27,0:57:27,"The fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It's important people know. Many people don't want to hurt other people's feelings, but it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem. It's a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, who grow up in Scranton. They look down on people who don't have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They looked down on people who are a different color. In fact, we're all Americans. The only way we're going to bring this country together is bring everybody together. There's nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on and we can defeat racism in American."
Chris Wallace:,0:34:41,9/29/20,,,0:59:41,0:58:21,0:58:21,"Vice President... I mean, President Trump, sir."
President Donal...:,0:34:43,9/29/20,,,0:59:43,0:58:23,0:58:23,"During the Obama-Biden administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred. You look at Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very... Many places, look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened... Frankly, it was more violent than what I'm even seeing now."
Vice President ...:,0:35:01,9/29/20,,,1:00:01,0:58:41,0:58:41,Oh my Lord.
President Donal...:,0:35:01,9/29/20,,,1:00:01,0:58:41,0:58:41,But the reason-
Vice President ...:,0:35:02,9/29/20,,,1:00:02,0:58:42,0:58:42,This is ridiculous.
President Donal...:,0:35:03,9/29/20,,,1:00:03,0:58:43,0:58:43,... is that the Democrats that run these cities-
Vice President ...:,0:35:05,9/29/20,,,1:00:05,0:58:45,0:58:45,Absolutely ridiculous.
President Donal...:,0:35:06,9/29/20,,,1:00:06,0:58:46,0:58:46,"... don't want to talk, like you, about law and order."
Vice President ...:,0:35:08,9/29/20,,,1:00:08,0:58:48,0:58:48,Violent crime-
President Donal...:,0:35:09,9/29/20,,,1:00:09,0:58:49,0:58:49,And you still haven't mentioned. Are you in favor of law and order?
Vice President ...:,0:35:12,9/29/20,,,1:00:12,0:58:52,0:58:52,I'm in favor of law. You- [crosstalk 00:35:15].
President Donal...:,0:35:14,9/29/20,,,1:00:14,0:58:54,0:58:54,Are you in favor of law and order? [crosstalk 00:35:17]
Chris Wallace:,0:35:16,9/29/20,,,1:00:16,0:58:56,0:58:56,"You asked a question, let him finish. [crosstalk 00:35:18] Let him answer."
Vice President ...:,0:35:20,9/29/20,,,1:00:20,0:59:00,0:59:00,"Law and order with justice, where people get treated fairly."
President Donal...:,0:35:23,9/29/20,,,1:00:23,0:59:03,0:59:03,Okay.
Vice President ...:,0:35:24,9/29/20,,,1:00:24,0:59:04,0:59:04,"And the fact of the matter is, violent crime went down 17%, 15% in our administration. It's gone up on his watch."
President Donal...:,0:35:31,9/29/20,,,1:00:31,0:59:11,0:59:11,It went down much more in ours.
Chris Wallace:,0:35:33,9/29/20,,,1:00:33,0:59:13,0:59:13,"All right, we're done- [crosstalk 00:35:35] Mr. President, you're going to be very happy because we're now going to talk about law and order."
President Donal...:,0:35:41,9/29/20,,,1:00:41,0:59:21,0:59:21,The places we had trouble were democratic run cities-
Chris Wallace:,0:35:44,9/29/20,,,1:00:44,0:59:24,0:59:24,"That's exactly my question. There has been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer particularly, and you often blame that on democratic mayors and democratic governors. But in fact, there have been equivalent spikes in Republican led cities, like Tulsa and Fort Worth. So the question is, is this really a..."
Chris Wallace:,0:36:03,9/29/20,,,1:01:03,0:59:43,0:59:43,"It's like Tulsa and Fort worth. So the question is, is this really a party issue?"
President Donal...:,0:36:05,9/29/20,,,1:01:05,0:59:45,0:59:45,"I think as a party issue, you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what's going on in Chicago where a 53 people were shot and eight died shot, if you look at New York where it's going up, like nobody's ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100%, 150%, 200% crime, it is crazy what's going on and he doesn't want to say law and order because he can't because he'll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it's over with. But if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have by the way our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you've never seen before."
Vice President ...:,0:36:45,9/29/20,,,1:01:45,1:00:25,1:00:25,He wouldn't know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn.
President Donal...:,0:36:47,9/29/20,,,1:01:47,1:00:27,1:00:27,"Oh, I know suburbs so much that you."
Chris Wallace:,0:36:48,9/29/20,,,1:01:48,1:00:28,1:00:28,Gentlemen wait a minute.
Vice President ...:,0:36:50,9/29/20,,,1:01:50,1:00:30,1:00:30,"I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don't work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There's many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID. They're dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment, they're being flooded, they're being burned out because his refusal to do anything. That's why the suburbs are in trouble."
Chris Wallace:,0:37:23,9/29/20,,,1:02:23,1:01:03,1:01:03,"I do want to talk about this issue of law and order though. And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders task force, you talked about quote re-imagining policing. First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support? If I might finish the question, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support the Black Lives Matter call for community control of policing?"
Vice President ...:,0:37:54,9/29/20,,,1:02:54,1:01:34,1:01:34,"Look, what I support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I'm totally opposed to defunding the police offices. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That's when crime went down, it didn't go up. It went down. And so we have to be..."
President Donal...:,0:38:35,9/29/20,,,1:03:35,1:02:15,1:02:15,That's not what they are talking about this. That's not what it is about. He's talking about defunding the police.
Vice President ...:,0:38:39,9/29/20,,,1:03:39,1:02:19,1:02:19,That is not true.
President Donal...:,0:38:40,9/29/20,,,1:03:40,1:02:20,1:02:20,He doesn't have any law support. He has no law enforcement.
Vice President ...:,0:38:45,9/29/20,,,1:03:45,1:02:25,1:02:25,That's not true.
President Donal...:,0:38:45,9/29/20,,,1:03:45,1:02:25,1:02:25,"He has almost nothing. Oh, really, who do you have name one group that supports you name one group that came out and supported you. Go ahead. Think we have time."
Vice President ...:,0:38:54,9/29/20,,,1:03:54,1:02:34,1:02:34,We don't have time to do anything.
President Donal...:,0:38:55,9/29/20,,,1:03:55,1:02:35,1:02:35,"No, no think right now. Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you."
Chris Wallace:,0:39:00,9/29/20,,,1:04:00,1:02:40,1:02:40,"Now, gentleman. I think I'm going to tell I'm going to take back the bottom line."
President Donal...:,0:39:03,9/29/20,,,1:04:03,1:02:43,1:02:43,There aren't any.
Chris Wallace:,0:39:04,9/29/20,,,1:04:04,1:02:44,1:02:44,"And I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent in Portland, Oregon, especially we had more than a 100 straight days of protests, which I think you would agree, you talk about peaceful protests. Many of those turned into riots. Mr. Vice-president you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have though is as the democratic nominee, and earlier tonight, you said that you are the Democratic Party right now, have you ever called the Democratic Mayor of Portland or the Democratic Governor of Oregon and said, ‚ÄúHey, you got to stop this, bring in the National Guard, do whatever it takes, but you'd stop the days and months of violence in Portland.‚Äù"
Vice President ...:,0:39:50,9/29/20,,,1:04:50,1:03:30,1:03:30,I don't hold public office. Now I am a former vice president. I've made it clear. I've made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. It should be prosecuted and anyone who committed it should be prosecuted.
Chris Wallace:,0:40:02,9/29/20,,,1:05:02,1:03:42,1:03:42,But you've never called for the people...
President Donal...:,0:40:02,9/29/20,,,1:05:02,1:03:42,1:03:42,He's never done that.
Chris Wallace:,0:40:02,9/29/20,,,1:05:02,1:03:42,1:03:42,"Excuse me, sir. You had never called for the leaders in Portland and in Oregon to call and bring in the National Guard and knock off a 100 days of riots."
Vice President ...:,0:40:15,9/29/20,,,1:05:15,1:03:55,1:03:55,They can in fact take care of it if he just stay out of the way.
President Donal...:,0:40:19,9/29/20,,,1:05:19,1:03:59,1:03:59,Oh really? I sent in the US Marshalls to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him for three days Portland didn't do anything. I sent in the US Marshals they took care of business.
Chris Wallace:,0:40:33,9/29/20,,,1:05:33,1:04:13,1:04:13,Go ahead sir.
Vice President ...:,0:40:34,9/29/20,,,1:05:34,1:04:14,1:04:14,"And by the way his own former spokesperson said, ‚ÄúRiots and chaos and violence help he cause.‚Äù That's what this is all about."
President Donal...:,0:40:43,9/29/20,,,1:05:43,1:04:23,1:04:23,I don't know who said that.
Vice President ...:,0:40:44,9/29/20,,,1:05:44,1:04:24,1:04:24,I do.
President Donal...:,0:40:45,9/29/20,,,1:05:45,1:04:25,1:04:25,Who?
Vice President ...:,0:40:46,9/29/20,,,1:05:46,1:04:26,1:04:26,I think Kellyanne Conway.
President Donal...:,0:40:48,9/29/20,,,1:05:48,1:04:28,1:04:28,I don't think she said that.
Vice President ...:,0:40:48,9/29/20,,,1:05:48,1:04:28,1:04:28,She said that.
President Donal...:,0:40:49,9/29/20,,,1:05:49,1:04:29,1:04:29,I don't think so.
Vice President ...:,0:40:50,9/29/20,,,1:05:50,1:04:30,1:04:30,"Here's the point, the point is that that's why he keeps trying to rile everything up. He doesn't want to calm things down instead of going in and talking to people and saying, ‚ÄúLet's get everybody together. Figure out how to deal with this.‚Äù What's he do? He just pours gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary time."
Chris Wallace:,0:41:10,9/29/20,,,1:06:10,1:04:50,1:04:50,"Okay. And to end this, button up this segment I'm going to give you a minute to answer, sir. You have repeatedly criticized..."
President Donal...:,0:41:16,9/29/20,,,1:06:16,1:04:56,1:04:56,Does it mean I have to answer his stuff.
Chris Wallace:,0:41:17,9/29/20,,,1:06:17,1:04:57,1:04:57,You have repeatedly...
President Donal...:,0:41:18,9/29/20,,,1:06:18,1:04:58,1:04:58,"Wait a second, you have made a statement."
Chris Wallace:,0:41:19,9/29/20,,,1:06:19,1:04:59,1:04:59,You've been talking back and forth. I'm asking you.
President Donal...:,0:41:22,9/29/20,,,1:06:22,1:05:02,1:05:02,I would love to end it.
Chris Wallace:,0:41:24,9/29/20,,,1:06:24,1:05:04,1:05:04,You know sir if you want to switch seats we could very quickly can do that.
President Donal...:,0:41:28,9/29/20,,,1:06:28,1:05:08,1:05:08,"I'll send in the National Guard, it would be over. That'd be no problem. But I don't want to accept the National Guard."
Chris Wallace:,0:41:33,9/29/20,,,1:06:33,1:05:13,1:05:13,You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left wing extremist groups. But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia group and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we've seen in Portland.
President Donal...:,0:41:57,9/29/20,,,1:06:57,1:05:37,1:05:37,"Sure, I'm will to do that."
Chris Wallace:,0:41:59,9/29/20,,,1:06:59,1:05:39,1:05:39,Are you prepared specifically to do it.
President Donal...:,0:42:00,9/29/20,,,1:07:00,1:05:40,1:05:40,I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing not from the right wing.
Chris Wallace:,0:42:04,9/29/20,,,1:07:04,1:05:44,1:05:44,But what are you saying?
President Donal...:,0:42:06,9/29/20,,,1:07:06,1:05:46,1:05:46,I'm willing to do anything. I want to see peace.
Chris Wallace:,0:42:08,9/29/20,,,1:07:08,1:05:48,1:05:48,"Well, do it, sir."
Vice President ...:,0:42:09,9/29/20,,,1:07:09,1:05:49,1:05:49,"Say it, do it say it."
President Donal...:,0:42:10,9/29/20,,,1:07:10,1:05:50,1:05:50,"What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who do you want me to condemn."
Chris Wallace:,0:42:14,9/29/20,,,1:07:14,1:05:54,1:05:54,White supremacist and white militia.
President Donal...:,0:42:18,9/29/20,,,1:07:18,1:05:58,1:05:58,"Okay, boys stand back and stand by. But I'll tell you what somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left wing."
Vice President ...:,0:42:28,9/29/20,,,1:07:28,1:06:08,1:06:08,"He's own FBI Director said unlike white supremacist, Antifa is an idea not an organization-"
President Donal...:,0:42:35,9/29/20,,,1:07:35,1:06:15,1:06:15,Oh you got to be kidding me.
Vice President ...:,0:42:36,9/29/20,,,1:07:36,1:06:16,1:06:16,... not a militia. That's what his FBI Director said.
President Donal...:,0:42:41,9/29/20,,,1:07:41,1:06:21,1:06:21,"Well, then you know what, he's wrong."
Chris Wallace:,0:42:42,9/29/20,,,1:07:42,1:06:22,1:06:22,"We're done, sir. Moving onto the next... [crosstalk 00:42:46]"
President Donal...:,0:42:46,9/29/20,,,1:07:46,1:06:26,1:06:26,Antifa is bad.
Vice President ...:,0:42:47,9/29/20,,,1:07:47,1:06:27,1:06:27,"Every body in your administration tells you the true, it's a bad idea. You have no idea about anything."
President Donal...:,0:42:53,9/29/20,,,1:07:53,1:06:33,1:06:33,"You know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group."
Chris Wallace:,0:42:56,9/29/20,,,1:07:56,1:06:36,1:06:36,"All right, gentlemen we're now moving onto the Trump-Biden record."
President Donal...:,0:42:58,9/29/20,,,1:07:58,1:06:38,1:06:38,"And you ought to be careful of them, they'll over throw you."
Chris Wallace:,0:43:00,9/29/20,,,1:08:00,1:06:40,1:06:40,"I'm going to ask a question. When the president seeks a second term, it is generally a referendum on his record but vice president Biden, you'd like to quote one of your dad's sayings, which is don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And in this case sir you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I'm going to ask each of you. Why should voters elect you president over your opponent in this segment, President Trump you'll go first, two minutes."
President Donal...:,0:43:30,9/29/20,,,1:08:30,1:07:10,1:07:10,"Because there is never been an administration or president who has done more than I've done in a period of three and a half years. And that's despite the impeachment hoax and you so what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I had a fight, both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that's done what I've done. The greatest, before COVID came in the greatest economy in history, lowest unemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going."
President Donal...:,0:44:03,9/29/20,,,1:09:03,1:07:43,1:07:43,"And by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling and they were saying it's time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now we're building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him, 308,000 people died because they didn't have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But we've rebuilt our military. And I'll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term I'll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300 and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons I'll have so many judges because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill."
President Donal...:,0:45:05,9/29/20,,,1:10:05,1:08:45,1:08:45,"When you leave office, you don't leave any judges. That's like, you just don't do that. They left 128 openings and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I'd say, if you left us 128 openings you can't be a good president. You can't be a good vice president but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it'll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. It's a record."
Chris Wallace:,0:45:34,9/29/20,,,1:10:34,1:09:14,1:09:14,"Looking at both of your records. Why should voters elect you President as opposed to president Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted."
Vice President ...:,0:45:42,9/29/20,,,1:10:42,1:09:22,1:09:22,"Under this president, we become weaker, sicker, poor, more divided and more violent. When I was vice president, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it. I did. We left him a booming economy and he caused the recession. With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I've gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we're not going to take any of his stuff. He's Putin's puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers."
President Donal...:,0:46:14,9/29/20,,,1:11:14,1:09:54,1:09:54,You son got three and a half million dollars.
Vice President ...:,0:46:17,9/29/20,,,1:11:17,1:09:57,1:09:57,"By the way, my son..."
Chris Wallace:,0:46:19,9/29/20,,,1:11:19,1:09:59,1:09:59,"Wait a minute. Mr. President, your campaign agreed to both sides would get two minute answers, uninterrupted. Well, you're a side agreed to it and why don't you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule. Okay, sir?"
Vice President ...:,0:46:33,9/29/20,,,1:11:33,1:10:13,1:10:13,He never keeps his word.
Chris Wallace:,0:46:34,9/29/20,,,1:11:34,1:10:14,1:10:14,"No, that was a rhetorical question."
Vice President ...:,0:46:37,9/29/20,,,1:11:37,1:10:17,1:10:17,Can you get back 30 seconds?
Chris Wallace:,0:46:39,9/29/20,,,1:11:39,1:10:19,1:10:19,"Yes. You may have, go ahead."
Vice President ...:,0:46:42,9/29/20,,,1:11:42,1:10:22,1:10:22,"So thirdly, we're poor. The billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over $3- $400 billion more just since COVID. You in the home, you got less you're in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent. When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He's President United States. It's on his watch. And with regard to more divided the nation, it can't stay divided. We can't be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got the Brown Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a Patriot and the people left behind there were heroes."
President Donal...:,0:47:39,9/29/20,,,1:12:39,1:11:19,1:11:19,Really?
Vice President ...:,0:47:39,9/29/20,,,1:12:39,1:11:19,1:11:19,And I resent-
President Donal...:,0:47:40,9/29/20,,,1:12:40,1:11:20,1:11:20,"Are you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter."
Vice President ...:,0:47:42,9/29/20,,,1:12:42,1:11:22,1:11:22,"I'm talking about my son, Beau Biden, you're talking about Hunter?"
President Donal...:,0:47:44,9/29/20,,,1:12:44,1:11:24,1:11:24,"I don't know, Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged."
Vice President ...:,0:47:51,9/29/20,,,1:12:51,1:11:31,1:11:31,That's not true he was not dishonorably discharged.
President Donal...:,0:47:53,9/29/20,,,1:12:53,1:11:33,1:11:33,For cocaine use. And he didn't have a job until you became vice president.
Vice President ...:,0:47:56,9/29/20,,,1:12:56,1:11:36,1:11:36,None of that is true.
President Donal...:,0:47:56,9/29/20,,,1:12:56,1:11:36,1:11:36,"Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places."
Vice President ...:,0:48:01,9/29/20,,,1:13:01,1:11:41,1:11:41,That is not true.
President Donal...:,0:48:04,9/29/20,,,1:13:04,1:11:44,1:11:44,He made a fortune and he didn't have a job.
Vice President ...:,0:48:07,9/29/20,,,1:13:07,1:11:47,1:11:47,"My son like a lot of people at home had a drug problem. He's overtaking it. He's fixed it. He's worked on it. And I'm proud of him, I'm proud of my son."
President Donal...:,0:48:17,9/29/20,,,1:13:17,1:11:57,1:11:57,But why was he given tens of millions of dollars?
Vice President ...:,0:48:19,9/29/20,,,1:13:19,1:11:59,1:11:59,He wasn't given tens of millions of dollars. [crosstalk 00:48:23] It was all discredited.
Chris Wallace:,0:48:27,9/29/20,,,1:13:27,1:12:07,1:12:07,"We've already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. Well, as the moderator, sir, I'm going to make a judgment call here."
President Donal...:,0:48:35,9/29/20,,,1:13:35,1:12:15,1:12:15,I know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the Mayor of Moscow.
Vice President ...:,0:48:39,9/29/20,,,1:13:39,1:12:19,1:12:19,That is not true. That report is totally discredited.
President Donal...:,0:48:43,9/29/20,,,1:13:43,1:12:23,1:12:23,Why did he get it?
Vice President ...:,0:48:45,9/29/20,,,1:13:45,1:12:25,1:12:25,Mitt Romney on that committee said it wasn't worth taxpayer's money. That report was written for political reason.
Chris Wallace:,0:48:50,9/29/20,,,1:13:50,1:12:30,1:12:30,I'd like to talk about climate change.
Vice President ...:,0:48:52,9/29/20,,,1:13:52,1:12:32,1:12:32,So would I.
Chris Wallace:,0:48:53,9/29/20,,,1:13:53,1:12:33,1:12:33,"Okay. The forest fires in the West are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blamed the fires on climate change. Mr. President, you said, I don't think the science knows. Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about the science of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?"
President Donal...:,0:49:27,9/29/20,,,1:14:27,1:13:07,1:13:07,"I want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon... If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven't destroyed our businesses. Our businesses aren't put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what's going on because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they're like tinder and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. You've got to have forest management."
Chris Wallace:,0:50:09,9/29/20,,,1:15:09,1:13:49,1:13:49,"What do you believe about the science of climate change, sir?"
President Donal...:,0:50:13,9/29/20,,,1:15:13,1:13:53,1:13:53,"I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air immaculate water and do whatever else we can that's good. We're planting a billion trees, the Billion Tree Project and it's very exciting for a lot of people."
Chris Wallace:,0:50:25,9/29/20,,,1:15:25,1:14:05,1:14:05,"You believe that human pollution, gas, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet."
President Donal...:,0:50:32,9/29/20,,,1:15:32,1:14:12,1:14:12,"I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes. I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest. Every year I get the call. California's burning, California's burning. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn't be getting those calls. In Europe, they live they're forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forest. They manage their forest. I was with the head of a major country, it's a forest city. He said, ‚ÄúSir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn't be that problem.‚Äù I spoke with the Governor about it. I'm getting along very well with the governor. But I said, ‚ÄúAt some point you can't every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.‚Äù That's burning down because of a lack of management."
Chris Wallace:,0:51:25,9/29/20,,,1:16:25,1:15:05,1:15:05,"But sir if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan which limited carbon emissions and power plants? Why have you relaxed...?"
President Donal...:,0:51:35,9/29/20,,,1:16:35,1:15:15,1:15:15,Because it was driving energy prices through the sky.
Vice President ...:,0:51:38,9/29/20,,,1:16:38,1:15:18,1:15:18,Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks?
President Donal...:,0:51:44,9/29/20,,,1:16:44,1:15:24,1:15:24,"Well, not really because what's happening is the car is much less expensive and it's a much safer car and you talk it about a tiny difference. And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500."
Chris Wallace:,0:52:06,9/29/20,,,1:17:06,1:15:46,1:15:46,But in the case of California they have simply ignored that.
President Donal...:,0:52:08,9/29/20,,,1:17:08,1:15:48,1:15:48,"No, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, by the way, we're going to see how that turns out. But a lot of people agree with me, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline. And I'm okay with electric cars too. I think I'm all for electric cars. I've given big incentives for electric cars but what they've done in California is just crazy."
Chris Wallace:,0:52:34,9/29/20,,,1:17:34,1:16:14,1:16:14,"All right, Vice president Biden. I'd like you to respond to the president's climate change record but I also want to ask you about a concern. You propose $2 trillion in green jobs. You talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking. Ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035 and zero none admission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The president says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs."
Vice President ...:,0:53:03,9/29/20,,,1:18:03,1:16:43,1:16:43,"He's absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, during our administration in the recovery act, I was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than are as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Nobody's going to build another coal fired plant in America. No one's going to build another oil fire plant in America. They're going to move to renewable energy. Number one, number two, we're going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that's run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, we're going to put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we're going to be building in the future. We're going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability of us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they'll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There's so many things that we can do..."
Vice President ...:,0:54:03,9/29/20,,,1:19:03,1:17:43,1:17:43,"Gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There's so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero, in terms of energy production, by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs, creating millions of good-paying jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what's happening. It's all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no relationship with foreign policy. The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that's emitted in the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, ""Here's $20 billion. Stop tearing down the forest. And If you don't, then you're going to have significant economic consequences."""
Chris Wallace:,0:55:11,9/29/20,,,1:20:11,1:18:51,1:18:51,"What about the argument that President Trump basically says, that you have to balance environmental interests and economic interests? And he's drawn his line."
Vice President ...:,0:55:21,9/29/20,,,1:20:21,1:19:01,1:19:01,"Well, he hasn't drawn a line. He wants to make sure that methane's not a problem. You can now emit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that you don't have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. This is the guy who says that, the fact that-"

Vice President ...:,0:55:49,9/29/20,,,1:20:49,1:19:29,1:19:29,I'm talking about the Biden plan [crosstalk 00:55:51]-

I actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes.

Look what's happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn't happen before. They're because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world's problem. But the rest of the world, we've got to get them to come along. That's why we have to get back into the Paris Accord."

His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. Number two, we're going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance. The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he's trying to scare people into thinking that it's not going to be legitimate."
Vice President ...:,1:00:55,9/29/20,,,1:25:55,1:24:35,1:24:35,"Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote. If you're able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you're able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you, because you will... He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. And in terms of whether or not... When the votes are counted and they're all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted. If I lose, that'll be accepted. But by the way, if in fact he says, he's not sure what he's going to accept. Well, let me tell you something, it doesn't matter, because if we get the votes, it's going to be all over. He's going to go. He can't stay in power. It won't happen. It won't happen, so vote. Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies?"
Chris Wallace:,1:01:52,9/29/20,,,1:26:52,1:25:32,1:25:32,"Mr. President, two minutes."
President Donal...:,1:01:53,9/29/20,,,1:26:53,1:25:33,1:25:33,"So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and we've caught them. We've caught them all. We've got it all on tape. We've caught them all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office."
President Donal...:,1:02:35,9/29/20,,,1:27:35,1:26:15,1:26:15,"He knew about it too. So don't tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, it's a disaster. A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay. You're soliciting. You're asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited... They're sending millions of ballots all over the country. There's fraud. They found them in creeks. They found some, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They're being sent all over the place. They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen. The other thing, it's nice. On November 3rd, you're watching, and you see who won the election. And I think we're going to do well because people are really happy with the job we've done."
President Donal...:,1:03:22,9/29/20,,,1:28:22,1:27:02,1:27:02,"But you know what? We won't know. We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They're not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election could be won or lost with that. They're losing 30 and 40%. It's a fraud, and it's a shame. And can you imagine where they say, ""You have to have your ballot in by November 10th."" November 10th. That's seven days after the election, in theory, should have been announced. We have major states [crosstalk 01:03:58] with that-"
Chris Wallace:,1:03:58,9/29/20,,,1:28:58,1:27:38,1:27:38,Sir.
President Donal...:,1:03:58,9/29/20,,,1:28:58,1:27:38,1:27:38,... all run by Democrats-
Chris Wallace:,1:03:59,9/29/20,,,1:28:59,1:27:39,1:27:39,Two minutes is two minutes.
President Donal...:,1:04:00,9/29/20,,,1:29:00,1:27:40,1:27:40,All run by Democrats.
Chris Wallace:,1:04:02,9/29/20,,,1:29:02,1:27:42,1:27:42,President Trump-
President Donal...:,1:04:02,9/29/20,,,1:29:02,1:27:42,1:27:42,It's a rigged election.
Chris Wallace:,1:04:04,9/29/20,,,1:29:04,1:27:44,1:27:44,"You're going to be able to continue. You have been charging for months that mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. You say it's rigged [crosstalk 00:01:04:11], that it's going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail-in voting. That was more than a quarter of all the voters that year, cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any dispute?"
President Donal...:,1:04:38,9/29/20,,,1:29:38,1:28:18,1:28:18,"Yeah. I think I'm counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely. I hope we don't need them, in terms of the election itself. But for the ballots, I think so, because what's happening is incredible. I read today where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They take them. We don't like them. We don't like them. They throw them out-"
Chris Wallace:,1:04:59,9/29/20,,,1:29:59,1:28:39,1:28:39,But what are you going to do about it-
President Donal...:,1:04:59,9/29/20,,,1:29:59,1:28:39,1:28:39,... left and right.
Chris Wallace:,1:05:00,9/29/20,,,1:30:00,1:28:40,1:28:40,There are millions of ballots going out right now. What are you going to do-
President Donal...:,1:05:02,9/29/20,,,1:30:02,1:28:42,1:28:42,"What you do is you go and vote. You do a solicited ballot, and that's okay-"
Chris Wallace:,1:05:05,9/29/20,,,1:30:05,1:28:45,1:28:45,No. No. I know your complaint [crosstalk 01:05:05]. I'm asking you about the fact that millions of people have received-
President Donal...:,1:05:08,9/29/20,,,1:30:08,1:28:48,1:28:48,You go and vote. You go and vote-
Chris Wallace:,1:05:11,9/29/20,,,1:30:11,1:28:51,1:28:51,"No. But what I'm saying is [crosstalk 01:05:11], what are you going to do about the fact that millions of people-"
President Donal...:,1:05:14,9/29/20,,,1:30:14,1:28:54,1:28:54,"You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you're sending it in, they're sending it back and you're sending. They have mailmen with lots of it. Did you see what's going on? Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots. They're being sold. They're being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country."
Vice President ...:,1:05:30,9/29/20,,,1:30:30,1:29:10,1:29:10,There is no [crosstalk 01:05:32]... There is no evidence of that-
President Donal...:,1:05:33,9/29/20,,,1:30:33,1:29:13,1:29:13,This is not going to end well.
Vice President ...:,1:05:34,9/29/20,,,1:30:34,1:29:14,1:29:14,There is no evidence of that-
President Donal...:,1:05:34,9/29/20,,,1:30:34,1:29:14,1:29:14,This is not going to end well-
Chris Wallace:,1:05:37,9/29/20,,,1:30:37,1:29:17,1:29:17,"Okay. Vice President Biden, in fact, go ahead, sir-"
Vice President ...:,1:05:37,9/29/20,,,1:30:37,1:29:17,1:29:17,"Five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more. Five, including two Republican states. And you don't have to solicit the ballot. It's sent to you. It's sent to your home. What they're saying is that it has to be a postmark by election day. If it doesn't get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He's just afraid of counting the votes-"
President Donal...:,1:06:03,9/29/20,,,1:31:03,1:29:43,1:29:43,You're wrong. You're wrong [crosstalk 01:06:04]. I love counting the votes [crosstalk 01:06:05]-
Chris Wallace:,1:06:05,9/29/20,,,1:31:05,1:29:45,1:29:45,I want to continue with you on this [crosstalk 01:06:06] Vice President Biden-
President Donal...:,1:06:07,9/29/20,,,1:31:07,1:29:47,1:29:47,"Chris, he's so wrong when he makes a statement like that-"
Chris Wallace:,1:06:09,9/29/20,,,1:31:09,1:29:49,1:29:49,"No. Excuse me. Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity, or they missed [crosstalk 01:06:28] the deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett will settle any dispute?"
Vice President ...:,1:06:36,9/29/20,,,1:31:36,1:30:16,1:30:16,"I am concerned that any court would settle this, because here's the deal. When you get a ballot and you fill it out, you're supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn't know, you have someone say that, this is me. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that's you before the ballot is thrown out, that's sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct I. Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say it's you. That is totally legitimate."
Chris Wallace:,1:07:09,9/29/20,,,1:32:09,1:30:49,1:30:49,All right.
President Donal...:,1:07:10,9/29/20,,,1:32:10,1:30:50,1:30:50,Excuse me [crosstalk 01:07:11]-
Chris Wallace:,1:07:12,9/29/20,,,1:32:12,1:30:52,1:30:52,"No. No. No. I have a final [crosstalk 00:13:12]. Gentlemen, I have a final question [crosstalk 01:07:14]-"
President Donal...:,1:07:15,9/29/20,,,1:32:15,1:30:55,1:30:55,"You know it can't be done. You know it can't, and already, there's been fraud [crosstalk 01:07:19]-"
Vice President ...:,1:07:19,9/29/20,,,1:32:19,1:30:59,1:30:59,Mail service delivers [crosstalk 01:07:21] 185 million pieces of mail a day [crosstalk 01:07:24]-
Chris Wallace:,1:07:24,9/29/20,,,1:32:24,1:31:04,1:31:04,"We can keep talking. In eight states, [crosstalk 01:07:27] election workers are prohibited, currently by law, eight states, from even beginning to process ballots, even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them until election day. That means that it's likely, because there's going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is, that it could be days. It could be weeks-"
President Donal...:,1:07:50,9/29/20,,,1:32:50,1:31:30,1:31:30,Could be months-
Chris Wallace:,1:07:50,9/29/20,,,1:32:50,1:31:30,1:31:30,"... until we find out who the new president is. First for you, sir. Finally, for the vice president, and I hope neither of you will interrupt the other. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified? President Trump, you go first-"
President Donal...:,1:08:16,9/29/20,,,1:33:16,1:31:56,1:31:56,"I'm urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully, because that's what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went in to watch. They're called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren't allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging my people. I hope it's going to be a fair election. If it's a fair election-"
Chris Wallace:,1:08:44,9/29/20,,,1:33:44,1:32:24,1:32:24,You're urging them what?
President Donal...:,1:08:45,9/29/20,,,1:33:45,1:32:25,1:32:25,"... I am 100% on board. But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can't go along with that. And I'll tell you why-"
Chris Wallace:,1:08:53,9/29/20,,,1:33:53,1:32:33,1:32:33,"What does that mean, not go along-"
President Donal...:,1:08:53,9/29/20,,,1:33:53,1:32:33,1:32:33,... from a common sense-
Chris Wallace:,1:08:54,9/29/20,,,1:33:54,1:32:34,1:32:34,Does that mean you're going to tell your people-
President Donal...:,1:08:55,9/29/20,,,1:33:55,1:32:35,1:32:35,I'll tell you what it means-
Chris Wallace:,1:08:55,9/29/20,,,1:33:55,1:32:35,1:32:35,... to take to the streets?
President Donal...:,1:08:56,9/29/20,,,1:33:56,1:32:36,1:32:36,It means you have a fraudulent election. You're sending out 80 million ballots-
Chris Wallace:,1:09:00,9/29/20,,,1:34:00,1:32:40,1:32:40,And what would you do about that?
President Donal...:,1:09:01,9/29/20,,,1:34:01,1:32:41,1:32:41,"They're not equipped... These people aren't equipped to handle it, number one. Number two, they cheat. They cheat. Hey, they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots. There were military. They all had the name Trump on them."
Chris Wallace:,1:09:17,9/29/20,,,1:34:17,1:32:57,1:32:57,Vice President Biden-
President Donal...:,1:09:17,9/29/20,,,1:34:17,1:32:57,1:32:57,You think that's good?
Chris Wallace:,1:09:18,9/29/20,,,1:34:18,1:32:58,1:32:58,"Vice President Biden, final question for you. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted? And will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?"
Vice President ...:,1:09:30,9/29/20,,,1:34:30,1:33:10,1:33:10,"Yes. And here's the deal. We count the ballots, as you pointed out. Some of these ballots in some states can't even be opened until election day. And if there's thousands of ballots, it's going to take time to do it. And by the way, our military... They've been voting by ballots since the end of the Civil War, in effect. And that's what's going to happen. Why is it, for them, somehow not fraudulent. It's the same process. It's honest. No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that somehow it's a fraudulent process."
President Donal...:,1:10:07,9/29/20,,,1:35:07,1:33:47,1:33:47,It's already been established. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney's race-
Chris Wallace:,1:10:10,9/29/20,,,1:35:10,1:33:50,1:33:50,"I asked you. You had an opportunity to respond [crosstalk 01:10:13]. Go ahead [crosstalk 01:10:14]. Vice President Biden, go ahead."
Vice President ...:,1:10:15,9/29/20,,,1:35:15,1:33:55,1:33:55,"He has no idea what he's talking about. Here's the deal. The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too. You know why? Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that'll be the end of it. That'll be the end of it. And if it's me, in fact, fine. If it's not me, I'll support the outcome. And I'll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I'll be a president for Democrats and Republicans. And this guy-"
President Donal...:,1:10:41,9/29/20,,,1:35:41,1:34:21,1:34:21,I want to see an honest ballot cut-
Chris Wallace:,1:10:43,9/29/20,,,1:35:43,1:34:23,1:34:23,"Gentlemen, just say that's the end of it [crosstalk 01:10:45]. This is the end of this debate-"
President Donal...:,1:10:47,9/29/20,,,1:35:47,1:34:27,1:34:27,I want to see an honest ballot count.
Chris Wallace:,1:10:48,9/29/20,,,1:35:48,1:34:28,1:34:28,We're going to leave it there-
President Donal...:,1:10:49,9/29/20,,,1:35:49,1:34:29,1:34:29,And I think he does too-
Chris Wallace:,1:10:50,9/29/20,,,1:35:50,1:34:30,1:34:30,"... to be continued in more debates as we go on. President Trump, Vice President Biden, it's been an interesting hour and a half. I want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in. We want to thank Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic for hosting this event. The next debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, will be one week from tomorrow, October 7th, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The two vice presidential nominees, Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will debate at 9:00 PM Eastern that night. We hope you watch. Until then, thank you, and good night. Thank you."
